The live website can be found [here](https://anluke.github.io/candle-realm/).




## Purpose

This website was created for the purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.  
The project was built using the knowledge and skills gained from the HTML & CSS. A full list of technologies can be found in the technologies section of this document.  

Project was built as an idea for a small company selling custom-made candles with natural ingredients but also oferring 'Do-It-Yourself' kits to showcase the simplicity in candle-making and mixing/testing different ingredients.  
The idea is to look simple but informing enough to catch someone's attention in hope to build a relationship.
