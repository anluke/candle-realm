This project is a static website for a fictitious Candle Making company, called **Candle Realm**.  
The live website can be found [here](https://anluke.github.io/candle-realm/).




## Purpose

This website was created to complete the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course.  
The project was built using the knowledge and skills gained from the HTML & CSS. A full list of technologies can be found in the technologies section of this document.  

Project was built as an idea for a small company selling custom-made candles with natural ingredients but also oferring 'Do-It-Yourself' kits to showcase the simplicity in candle-making and mixing/testing different ingredients.  
The idea is to look simple but informing enough to catch someone's attention in hope to build a relationship.

    - The Hero section contains a greeting and provides a user with clear information about what the site is and the idea behind the company.

    - The aim for a background was to be peaceful yet welcoming and to blend in well with other colors on the website.

    - Hero section should catch the user's attention and look like a cozy place.    

<br />

- __Main Section__  

    ![Main](https://github.com/anluke/candle-realm/blob/main/assets/readme-images/main-section.png?raw=true)

    - The purpose of the Main Section is to provide a user with information regarding the company and ingredients that we use.  
    It is just below the 'Hero-Section' but it's not taking too much space as the idea is to be inviting and informational about the products.

    - It has another welcoming heading that's notifying a user that we are one of the best suppliers of custom-made products and 'Do-It-Yourself' kits.

    - It also informs the user that all of the products are made locally and by hand. Depending on the user's needs we have everything to get them started.

    - It also has three examples of the most popular types of wax currently in the world.  
    Every ingredient has a description and a picture giving the best example of the difference between the three.  
    It also gives a quick description regarding their individual benefits or cons.

    - At the bottom of the main section is a time-lapse video showing a difference between them in a Real-Life setting.  
    It has a nice melody to it and is also very positive and inviting.
