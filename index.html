        <h2>Candle Ingredients</h2>

        <p>As mentioned, candles are made from different types of wax. More info can be found below:</p>


        <div class="beeswax-img"></div>
        <h3>BeesWax</h3>
        <p>Oldest material used for candles. Beeswax candles have even been found in the pyramids of ancient Egypt!
            Beeswax is an all-natural, non-toxic substance used to make bee honeycombs. Not used often for scented
            candles as it has its own honey aroma.</p>

        <div class="soywax-img"></div>
        <h3>Soy Wax</h3>
        <p>Comes from soybean oil which is more sustainable and environmentally friendly. It is a great choice for those
            wanting to live the vegan/vegetarian lifestyle. Soy wax is often blended with other waxes to capitalize on
            the best of both waxes. Known to have mild softer fragrance.</p>

        <div class="parrafin-img"></div>
        <h3>Paraffin Wax</h3>
        <p>The most common material for the mass market simply for its price.
            It comes with a lot of downsides to your health and environment. It is a final byproduct of petroleum. Known
            to produce the strongest fragrances.</p>
